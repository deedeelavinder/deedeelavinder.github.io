## { work }

I currently work as a backend software engineer in the payments industry.


## { life }

I am mother to three amazing people and two dogs. I also volunteer extensively in my community, love being outside, and never find quite enough time for all the reading I would like to do.


## { giving back }

With a mission to inspire women to excel in technology careers, Women Who Code is the organization to which I chose to channel my volunteer energy. Helping to bring womxn together for inspiration, encouragement, learning new skills, and celebration of accomplishments is a joy.


## { me }

People who know me describe me as collaborative, ambitious, patient, and compassionate. I welcome challenges, failure, and constructive criticism as opportunities for growth and development. Wired for optimism, I bring enthusiasm, kindness, and an open mind to everything I do.

The skills I value and rely on the most include creative problem solving, analytical thinking, and connecting with people. I am a systems thinker and a detail lover.
